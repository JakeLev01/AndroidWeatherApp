# AndroidWeatherApp
Android Weather App coded using Android Studio and xml that uses OneCall API to gather weather information in Austin, Texas


In this project I created a weather app in Android Studio that utilized the OneCall API to gather weather data for Austin, Texas and display it using xml files. This project uses Networking and Threads to make a call to the API using my personal API key to retrieve data based on Longitude and Latitude in Austin, Texas. All of this code is in NetworkThread.java.

I used .xml files to create the layouts for each page. I constructed a main page to display current condidtions in Austin. Additionally, I designed 2 buttons to take the uesr to pages to display hourly and weekly forecasts for Austin.
